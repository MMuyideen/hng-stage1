## Prerequisites

- An Azure account
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands
- SSH client (e.g., PuTTY for Windows or Terminal for macOS/Linux)
- Your static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Azure VM Setup

1. Log in to the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com).
2. Create a new Virtual Machine:
   - Click "Create a resource" > "Virtual Machine"
   - Choose Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS or later
   - Select appropriate size (e.g., Standard_B1s for low traffic)
   - Enable public inbound ports: SSH (22) and HTTP (80)
   - Create and download SSH key
3. Once created, note the VM's public IP address.

## Server Configuration

1. SSH into your VM:
   ```
   ssh -i <path-to-private-key> azureuser@<your-vm-ip>
   ```

2. Update the system:
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

3. Install NGINX:
   ```
   sudo apt install nginx -y
   ```

4. Start and enable NGINX:
   ```
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   sudo systemctl enable nginx
   ```

5. Configure firewall:
   ```
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

## Website Deployment

1. Upload your website files to the VM:
   ```
   scp -i <path-to-private-key> -r /path/to/your/website/* azureuser@<your-vm-ip>:/home/azureuser/
   ```

2. Move files to NGINX's serving directory:
   ```
   sudo mv /home/azureuser/* /var/www/html/
   ```

3. Set proper permissions:
   ```
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
   ```

4. Configure NGINX (if needed):
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```
   Ensure the `root` directive points to `/var/www/html`.

5. Test NGINX configuration:
   ```
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

6. Reload NGINX:
   ```
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you can't access your website:

1. Check NGINX status:
   ```
   sudo systemctl status nginx
   ```

2. Verify firewall settings:
   ```
   sudo ufw status
   ```

3. Check NGINX error logs:
   ```
   sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```

4. Ensure Azure NSG allows inbound traffic on port 80.

5. Verify file permissions in `/var/www/html`.

## Maintenance

1. Regularly update your system:
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. Monitor logs:
   ```
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
   ```

3. Backup your website files periodically.

## Security Considerations

1. Keep your system and NGINX updated.
2. Use strong SSH keys and disable password authentication.
3. Consider implementing HTTPS using Let's Encrypt.
4. Regularly review and update Azure Network Security Group rules.
5. Implement DDoS protection if needed.

This README provides a comprehensive guide for deploying and maintaining your static website on an Azure VM. It covers the entire process from setting up the VM to troubleshooting common issues, and includes important security considerations. You can customize this further based on your specific needs or any additional features of your website.
